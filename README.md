## Tips
This model obtained the best results. However, it did not have the gfinal code architecture. Which is why it has to be repoduced on this branch : the order of the features is different in the new version. Here it is handcrafted, abstract, neighbors, keywords. 

The final project is available on our github, and contains all the features.
